# Learning path: Level 0 → Level 2

Status: draft

Goal: a handler can follow this sequence without missing prerequisites.

---

## How to use this path

- Treat this as a playlist, not a prison.
- If your dog can't eat or can't disengage, jump straight to Safety gating + decompression.
- Move forward by pass criteria, not by calendar time.
