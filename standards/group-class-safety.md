# Standard: Group Class Safety (Meetups + Classes)
Version: 1.0  
Updated: 2026-01-10  
Status: draft  
Applies to: **ODA weekly meetups, group classes, and open training sessions.**

---

## 1) Purpose

Group training is a safety system disguised as a dog class.

This standard defines:
- eligibility + screening
- space and movement rules
- gear expectations
- threshold management
- emergency protocols
- incident documentation

---

## 2) Core rules (the ones you do not negotiate)

- **No on-leash greetings** between dogs.
- Maintain **spacing**; dogs do not “meet” unless explicitly planned and controlled.
- Dogs remain under control: leash/long line unless a specific enclosed off-leash protocol is active.
- If a dog goes over threshold: **increase distance, add barriers, reduce demands**.
- Handlers must be able to **physically hold** their dog safely (or use appropriate management equipment).

---

## 3) Eligibility (who can attend)

### Minimum requirements
- Dog is healthy enough for light training (no vomiting/diarrhea/fever).
- Dog is wearing:
  - flat collar or harness
  - standard leash (4–6 ft) OR long line when specified
- Handler can follow safety instructions and maintain distance.

### Strongly recommended
- Vaccinations consistent with local veterinary guidance (core vaccines)
- ID tag + microchip
- Treat pouch and high-value treats

### Not eligible for group meetups (without separate plan)
- Known bite history toward humans (unless the meetup is specifically structured for that and staffed appropriately)
- Severe reactivity where the dog cannot remain under threshold at the meetup location even with distance
- Dogs in heat (unless your policies explicitly allow it with strict management)

> When in doubt: require a **private orientation** before group attendance.

---

## 4) Gear rules

### Approved
- Y-front harness or well-fitting harness
- flat collar
- long line for recall practice (10–30 ft; avoid retractables)
- basket muzzle (conditioned) if needed for safety

### Not allowed in group space
- retractable leashes
- choke/prong as default tools in the group environment
- anything that escalates risk (poorly fitted gear, broken clips)

---

## 5) Space + movement rules (layout standards)

### Minimum spacing
- Default: **10–15 ft** between dogs (more if needed).
- “Reactive buffer lanes” should exist (an outer ring or behind-barrier zone).

### Recommended layout
- Stations arranged in a **wide circle** or **two rows** facing the same direction.
- Clear “escape routes” for dogs that need distance.
- Visual barriers available (tarps, x-pens, cars, shrubs, portable screens).

### Movement protocol
- Dogs move **one at a time** when changing stations.
- Use a “traffic controller” helper if available.
- Practice “eyes up / dog close” during transitions.

---

## 6) Color system (fast communication)

- **Green**: dog is under threshold; can work and take food.
- **Yellow**: dog is borderline; increase distance and simplify.
- **Red**: dog is over threshold; leave the line / go behind barrier / decompress.

This is about **management**, not judgment.

---

## 7) Threshold + decompression protocol

When a dog escalates (barking/lunging/freezing/panicking):
1. **Stop training** for that dog.
2. Increase distance immediately.
3. Add barrier if possible.
4. Switch to decompression:
   - scatter feed / sniffing
   - station behind barrier
   - calm pattern (1–2–3 treat, hand target, “find it”)
5. Return only when dog is eating and reorienting.

If repeated red events occur: require a private session or a quieter environment.

---

## 8) Emergency protocols

### Loose dog
- Everyone: stop moving, shorten leashes, toss treats to keep dogs busy.
- One person: calmly retrieve loose dog (do not chase).
- Use barriers/vehicles to block paths.

### Dog fight
- Shout: “DROP LEASHES / STEP BACK” if safe and appropriate.
- Separate using barriers, boards, hoses, or “wheelbarrow” technique **only if trained**.
- After separation: create distance; check injuries; end session.

### Bite / injury
- Stop the session.
- Provide first aid as appropriate.
- Document immediately (see templates).
- Recommend medical care; when in doubt, urgent care/vet.

---

## 9) Paperwork + templates (keep it simple)

Create/Use:
- `templates/intake-form.md`
- `templates/meetup-eligibility.md`
- `templates/incident-report.md`
- `templates/homework-card.md`

---

## 10) Staff roles (even if informal)

- **Instructor lead**: runs lesson, sets pace, makes calls.
- **Safety lead**: watches threshold + spacing, stops risky interactions.
- **Greeter**: manages arrivals, directs parking/spacing.
- **Runner**: retrieves cones/barriers, helps with logistics.

If you have only one person: be conservative with dog count and complexity.


---

## Remote cue devices (vibrate/beep/flash)
- Allowed only as **conditioned cues** (not punishers).
- Dog must be comfortable wearing the device and show no startle/fear.
- Instructor may restrict use if it disrupts safety or increases arousal.
- See: `remote-cue-devices.md`.
