# Open Dog Academy — Academy Standards (Shared)
Status: draft

**Purpose:** single source of truth for measurement, criteria, and training “rules” referenced by all class guides.

**Version:** 0.1 (modular refactor)  
**Updated:** 2026-01-10

## 1) Measurement standard (data-friendly)

> Class guides should reference this section instead of duplicating it.

### 3.1 Per-rep log fields
`skill_id, context, distraction_tier, distance_m, duration_s, correct_bool, latency_s, error_type, notes`

### 3.2 Distraction tiers
- D0 = none (quiet room)
- D1 = mild (yard, low novelty)
- D2 = moderate (people/dogs at distance, movement present)
- D3 = high (close distractions, high arousal contexts)

### 3.3 Default pass thresholds (unless overridden)
- Accuracy: **≥ 90%** over **20 trials**
- Latency: median **≤ 2.0s**
- Contexts: **3 contexts** (indoor / yard / public-like)
- Graduation: pass at **D2**

### 3.4 Error taxonomy (standard)
`late_response, no_response, broke_position, creep, anticipate, wrong_position, handler_prompted, arousal_spike, stress_withdrawal`

---

## 2) Reinforcement rules (academy default)

### 2.3 Reinforcement rules (academy default)
- Marker-based teaching (click/word)
- Reward placement steers body position
- Keep reps short; avoid drilling
- No punishment-based pressure during learning reps

---

---

## 3) Cue hygiene (especially recall)

### 2.3 Recall cue hygiene
- Don’t repeat cues (repetition predicts “optional”)
- Never punish after the dog returns
- Don’t use recall only to end fun (avoid poisoned association)
- When moving from long line → off-leash, **increase reinforcement** temporarily

---

---

## 4) Pass/fail conventions (recommended)

- **Pass a skill at a given distraction tier** when the dog meets the guide’s criteria **for 2 sessions in a row**, with ≥ 5 reps per session (unless the skill is “few reps only,” e.g., emergency recall).
- **Regress** one level (distance/duration/distraction) after **2+ failures in a row**.
- **Success criteria should be stated as**: accuracy %, latency, distance, duration, and context (where applicable).

---

## 5) Error taxonomy (shared language)

- **Latency**: slow response after cue
- **Position error**: wrong placement/orientation
- **Break**: leaves position before release
- **Disengage failure**: cannot re-orient from distraction
- **Handler error**: late marker, unclear cue, poor setup
- **Environment error**: surprise distraction, unsafe context

> Use this taxonomy in notes so the logs stay comparable across classes.
