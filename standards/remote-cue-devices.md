# Standard: Remote Cue Devices (Vibrate • Beep • Flash)
Version: 1.0  
Updated: 2026-01-10  
Status: draft  
Applies to: **ODA classes and meetups** using remote devices for **tactile (vibrate), audible (beep), or visual (flashlight)** signals.

> ODA treats these functions as **conditioned cues** (signals), not punishers.  
> **Stim/shock is out of scope** for the ODA curriculum.

## 1) Purpose

Remote cue devices can be useful when you need:
- **Silent cues** (vibrate / light) in public spaces
- **Distance cues** (beep / light) without yelling
- A **“find me”** orienting signal when the dog is out of view
- Accessibility support (e.g., tactile cue for deaf dogs)

They can also create problems if introduced poorly:
- startle → avoidance
- cue confusion (dog scans environment instead of orienting)
- accidental pairing with scary moments (cue becomes a “bad news” predictor)

This standard makes the device **safe, predictable, and data-friendly**.

## 2) Definitions (ODA-specific)

- **Remote signal**: a device output (vibrate, beep, or light flash).
- **Conditioned signal**: a remote signal that predicts good things reliably.
- **Remote cue**: a conditioned signal that **prompts a specific behavior** (recall, down, place, orient).
- **Conditioned orienter**: signal → dog turns toward handler.
- **Conditioned interrupter (CI)**: signal → dog disengages from a low-level behavior and reorients.  
  *CI is only valid if it was built as positive conditioning and does not startle the dog.*

---

## 3) Non‑negotiables (safety + ethics)

- Remote signals are **never used to punish** or to “get back control” in panic moments.
- Do not “test” a signal **during fear, conflict, or pain**.
- Do not shine the flashlight **into the dog’s eyes** (or people’s eyes). Use ground/torso-directional flashes.
- If the dog shows stress with the device: **stop, downgrade**, recondition.

---

## 4) Eligibility and contraindications

### Eligibility (minimum)
- Dog can eat/play in the training environment.
- Dog has a working **reinforcer** (food or toy).
- Dog can perform the target behavior on a normal cue (voice/hand) at low distraction.
- Device fit is safe (see gear notes below).

### Contraindications (avoid or seek professional help)
- Dog panics with wearable gear or freezes with vibration/beep.
- Severe noise sensitivity.
- High fear / aggression cases where timing errors could worsen risk.
- Light sensitivity or seizure disorders (for flash use; if unsure, skip flash entirely).

## 5) Device setup: fit + handling rules

Place the device so it does not cause rubbing or restrict breathing.  
Always do a quick safety check before sessions:

**Pre‑session checklist**
- [ ] fit: snug enough not to spin; not tight; two-finger check (use common-sense comfort, not force)
- [ ] contact points/casing not rubbing raw spots
- [ ] device charged; buttons not sticking
- [ ] verify you can trigger the intended mode only (vibrate vs beep vs flash)
- [ ] dog happily accepts collar on/off (no avoidance)

**House rule**
- Collar time should predict good stuff. Do not “collar = work/stress.”

## 6) Conditioning ladder (the core protocol)

### Stage A — Wear comfort
Goal: dog shows neutral-to-happy body language when the device is worn.

**Criteria to advance**
- Dog approaches when device comes out (or at least does not avoid)
- No scratching/pawing at device after 30–60 seconds
- Normal movement, eating, play

### Stage B — Signal → Party (classical conditioning)
Goal: signal predicts reinforcement, not a demand.

**Protocol**
- Trigger the signal (vibrate OR beep OR flash).
- Immediately deliver a **jackpot** (5–10 treats or a short toy party).
- Repeat 10–20 reps over 2–5 mini sessions.

**Pass criteria**
- After signal, dog’s body language becomes *eager* (head turn to you, tail/ears perk appropriate to dog, quick approach).

### Stage C — Signal → Orient
Goal: signal creates an automatic check-in.

**Protocol**
- Signal → wait for head turn/eye contact → mark → reinforce.
- If no orient within 1–2 seconds: *help* (kissy sound, step away), then reinforce.

**Pass criteria**
- 8/10 reps: orient within 1 second in low distraction.

### Stage D — Signal → Known behavior
Pick ONE behavior first (usually recall or place).

**Protocol**
- Signal → cue the known behavior (voice/hand) → mark → reinforce.
- Gradually fade the voice cue so signal becomes the cue.

**Pass criteria**
- 8/10 reps at short distance, low distraction.

### Stage E — Generalize
Generalize by changing **one variable at a time**:
- distance, then distractions, then location, then duration

**Rule**
- If you increase difficulty, increase pay.

## 7) Cue mapping (choose a sane design)

Choose one “default meaning” per modality to prevent cue soup:

| Modality | Recommended role | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Vibrate | **Orient / recall** | private + tactile; useful in noise |
| Beep | **Orient / “find me”** | audible at distance; risk for noise-sensitive dogs |
| Flash | **Locate / orient** (night/low light only) | visual; can support “where is my human?” |

**Avoid**
- Assigning multiple meanings to the same signal early.
- Using beep/vibrate as an “uh-uh” or startle interrupt.

---

## 8) Troubleshooting (common failure modes)

### Dog startles (jump/freezes)
- Immediately stop signals.
- Return to Stage A or B with **lower intensity** (or switch modality).
- Pair signal with jackpots at home in a calm room.

### Dog scans environment instead of orienting
- You advanced too fast.
- Go back to Stage C and pay heavily for orienting.
- Reduce distractions.

### Signal works at home but not outside
- Generalization problem.
- Drop criteria outside: shorter distance, lower distractions, higher pay.

### Dog ignores signal when aroused
- Signal is not yet reliable at that arousal level.
- Use management (long line, distance, barriers).
- Build regulation skills; do not “stack” remote cues onto chaos.

## 9) Data logging (recommended fields)

Log remote-cue sessions like any other skill:

- `modality`: vibrate / beep / flash
- `latency_s`: signal → orient/behavior start
- `success`: yes/no
- `context`: location + distraction tier
- `notes`: stress signs, scanning, equipment issues
