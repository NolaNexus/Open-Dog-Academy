# Ops: Weekly Meetup Playbook
Version: 1.0  
Updated: 2026-01-10  
Status: draft  
Applies to: **free weekly meetups** (small group training sessions).

---

## 1) Purpose

This playbook makes your meetup:
- repeatable (same structure each week)
- safer (predictable rules and spacing)
- teachable (helpers can step in)
- scalable (you can add levels without chaos)

---

## 2) Meetup “operating system” (default constraints)

- Target group size: **4–6 dogs** (until you have trained helpers + reliable barriers).
- Default leash status: **on leash** (long line only in designated recall lanes).
- No on-leash greetings.
- Keep training blocks short: **3 blocks x 10–12 minutes**.
- Always include decompression time.

---

## 3) Pre‑meetup checklist (printable)

### Site + safety
- [ ] confirm location rules (dogs allowed, hours, waste disposal)
- [ ] identify escape routes + hazards (roads, wildlife, glass, kids)
- [ ] place cones/barriers to create station lines and buffer zones
- [ ] designate:
  - parking/loading area
  - “red zone” decompression space (behind barrier)
  - recall lane (if used)

### Supplies
- [ ] spare long line
- [ ] spare slip lead (emergency only, not training)
- [ ] barriers (tarps/x-pen/blankets)
- [ ] first aid kit (human + dog basics)
- [ ] water + bowls
- [ ] incident report forms + pen
- [ ] extra treats (for emergency scatters)

---

## 4) Arrival procedure (first 10 minutes)

1. **Park and wait**: no unloading until instructed if space is tight.
2. Handlers unload one at a time.
3. Each handler goes directly to a **station** and starts decompression:
   - scatter feed, sniffing, calm breathing time
4. Instructor quickly checks:
   - gear fit
   - leash type
   - dog threshold state (green/yellow/red)

## 5) Run-of-show (60 minutes)

### 0:00–0:10 — Arrival + decompression + safety briefing
- Read the 3 rules:
  - no greetings
  - keep spacing
  - ask for help early

### 0:10–0:20 — Warmup block (everyone)
- engagement + marker timing + easy wins
- pattern game (1–2–3 treat) or “find it” scatters

### 0:20–0:32 — Training Block A (skill of the day)
- teach or practice one key skill
- rotate help: instructor checks each team briefly

### 0:32–0:37 — Reset + decompress
- sniffing, water break, stationing

### 0:37–0:49 — Training Block B (proofing or pairing)
- same skill with one added variable OR a second related skill

### 0:49–0:54 — Reset + decompress

### 0:54–1:00 — Homework + graduation criteria
- hand out homework card (or read it aloud)
- define success criteria for next week

---

## 6) Safety triggers (when you downgrade/stop)
- repeated red-zone events
- handlers not maintaining spacing
- equipment failures
- dog cannot eat / cannot reorient

Call it early. A calm ending is a feature.

---

## 7) After-action review (5 minutes)
Immediately after:
- what went well?
- what nearly went wrong?
- what will we change next week?
- record incidents and near-misses

Use: `templates/incident-report.md` even for “almost incidents.”
