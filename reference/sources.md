# Sources Register

ODA is **PDF-free** by default. External sources are tracked as:
- URLs + metadata (canonical)
- your extract notes (what you learned + how it maps into ODA)

## Files
- `sources.yml` — the machine-readable source register
- `extracts/` — one Markdown file per source (`SRC_*`) with your notes

## How to use
1. Add a new entry to `sources.yml` (with a stable `source_id`)
2. Create `extracts/<source_id>.md`
3. Link the extract from any standard/skill/class where you use it

> Keep quotes short and compliant; prefer paraphrase + your own synthesis.
