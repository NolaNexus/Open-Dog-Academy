# Source Extracts

This folder holds **one Markdown note per source** in `reference/sources.yml`.

## Naming
- Use the `source_id` from `sources.yml` as the filename.
- Example: `SRC_AVSAB_2015_socialization.md`

## Recommended structure (lightweight)
- **Citation:** URL, author/org, date, accessed date
- **Key claims:** bullet list (paraphrase)
- **Limits / caveats:** what the source does *not* justify
- **ODA mappings:** which standards/skills/classes this supports
- **Quotes:** keep short and minimal

## Why this exists
A source registry without extracts turns into "trust me bro" over time.
These notes are how you keep ODA **evidence-traceable** while staying PDF-light.
