Export date: 2026-01-10

This is a **bases checklist**: a structured list of “things we should have *some* coverage for” to reach Wikipedia-level breadth.

## A) dogs (biology + development)
- development: puppy/adolescence/adult/senior
- physiology basics: fatigue, hydration, thermoregulation
- biomechanics: gait, jumping/turning risks
- sensory systems: scent, hearing, vision
- common health screening for working roles

## B) learning + behavior
- learning theory fundamentals (reinforcement, extinction, generalization)
- motor learning (practice design, contextual interference)
- behavior cases: reactivity, aggression, separation, noise phobia, resource guarding
- triage + referral system (must-have)

## C) working roles
- service (public access, handler skills, task taxonomy + ethics)
- detection (evaluation, bias mitigation)
- SAR (readiness, safety)
- protection/bitework: boundaries + refer-out policy

## D) sports
- rally, obedience, scent work
- agility (with injury prevention)
- tracking
- flyball/disc/dock
- herding (ethics + safety boundaries)
- tricks (confidence builders)

## E) law + policy (jurisdiction-aware)
- ADA (public access)
- housing (HUD/FHA)
- employment (EEOC/Title I)
- schools (504/IDEA/ADA)
- travel (DOT)
- state law (Montana) + SDiT + misrepresentation penalties (to be researched)

## F) operations + community
- hazards (cold/heat/wildlife/water/surfaces/noise/air quality/transport)

- open-source workflow + reviewer rubric
- accessibility/readability standards
- assessments + calibration protocol
- shelter volunteer ladder + enrichment + playgroups
- human factors: schedule realism, burnout, consistency
- kids + dogs
- multi-dog households
- gear: low-cost, DIY, maintenance, loaner library
- rope/line handling safety

## Coverage test
For each bullet item above, confirm at least one of:
- a Standard note exists, OR
- a Protocol/SOP exists, OR
- a Lesson exists, OR
- a planned Task stub exists in research/tasks_v3
If none exist: create a facet stub and add a task request.
