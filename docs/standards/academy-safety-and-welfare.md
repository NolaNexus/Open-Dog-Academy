# Open Dog Academy — Safety & Welfare (Shared)
Status: draft

**Purpose:** baseline safety policy for all training, with special emphasis on off-leash work.

**Version:** 0.1 (modular refactor)  
**Updated:** 2026-01-10

## 2) Safety policy (mandatory)

### 2.1 Non-negotiables
- Off-leash is not “tested.”
- If you can’t safely enforce a cue, don’t give it.
- Long line is used to **prevent rehearsal of ignoring**, not to punish.

### 2.2 Required gear (generalized)
- Harness or collar (safe attachment)
- 6 ft leash
- Long line 15–30 ft
- High-value reinforcement
- Optional: distinct emergency cue (word or whistle)

### 2.3 Recall cue hygiene
- Don’t repeat cues (repetition predicts “optional”)
- Never punish after the dog returns
- Don’t use recall only to end fun (avoid poisoned association)
- When moving from long line → off-leash, **increase reinforcement** temporarily

## Household safety add-ons (kids + multi-animal)

- Use barriers (baby gates, leashes, crates, pens) to prevent rehearsal of chaos.
- No dog–kid free-play without active adult supervision.
- Manage food, toys, and tight spaces to reduce conflict risk.
