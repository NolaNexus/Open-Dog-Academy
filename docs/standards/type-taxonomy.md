# Type taxonomy (optional)

Status: draft

This project uses **Type** tags to keep docs from becoming “one giant manual”.

We borrow the **Diátaxis** split:

- **tutorial** — learning-oriented, guided practice
- **how-to** — task-oriented, “do X to achieve Y”
- **reference** — facts and specs (no steps)
- **explanation** — why things work, mental models, tradeoffs

## ODA mapping (practical)

- Skills: `skill reference` (existing convention)
- Class guides: usually `how-to` + some `tutorial`
- Instructor guides: `how-to` (scripts) + `reference` (criteria)
- Manuals: mostly `explanation` + `reference`

## Not enforced yet

We’ll keep this as guidance until it stops feeling annoying.
Then we can add a validator that checks for `Type:` lines in selected folders.
