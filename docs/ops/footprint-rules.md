# Footprint rules

## Keep it small
- Avoid committing binaries (PDFs, large images, videos).
- Prefer links or external hosting for heavyweight media.

## Machine-owned docs
- `docs/_generated/**` is generated output. Do not hand edit.

## Stability > cleverness
- Prefer fewer dependencies and fewer plugins.
- Add tooling only when it removes ongoing maintenance.
