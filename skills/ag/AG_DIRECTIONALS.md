## 1) What this skill is

- **Definition:** (one sentence)
- **Handler goal:** (what you do)
- **Dog goal:** (what the dog does)

## 2) Why it matters

- (real-world value)
- (what it unlocks)

## 3) Setup

- **Environment:** D0 → D3 progression (see `../standards/academy-standards.md`)
- **Gear:** (leash/long line/targets/etc.)
- **Reinforcers:** (food/toy/life rewards) + recommended rate of pay

## 4) Teaching plan (default)

### Step A — Create the behavior (D0)
- **Reps:** 3–8 per mini-session
- **Mechanics:** cue → behavior → mark → pay
- **Reset:** (how to reset cleanly)

### Step B — Add duration / distance
- Increase one variable at a time.
- Keep latency fast; pay for speed.

### Step C — Add distraction + generalize
- Change **context** before changing **difficulty**.
- Use “easy win” reps between harder reps.

## 5) Pass criteria (suggested)

- **Accuracy:** ≥ 80% across 2 sessions at the current tier
- **Latency:** ≤ 3.0s (or tighter for precision skills)
- **Notes:** define what counts as a rep and what counts as a failure

## 6) Drills

1. **Micro-reps:** 5 reps, end, reset the dog
2. **Scatter → cue:** scatter food, cue once dog re-orients
3. **1 hard / 2 easy:** one challenge rep followed by two easy reps

## 7) Common pitfalls + fixes

- **Repeating cues** → pause, reset, lower difficulty
- **Slow responses** → pay for speed, shorten reps, reduce distractions
- **Frustration** → increase reinforcement rate, easier reps, add breaks
